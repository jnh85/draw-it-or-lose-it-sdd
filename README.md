- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  - The Gaming Room is a game development company. They wanted to develop a web-based version of their game "Draw It or Lose It". It's a game inspired by the old game show, "Win, Lose, or Draw." Each game consists of four one-minute rounds where images are gradually rendered, and teams must guess what the image is as soon as possible.

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  - I think that the UML class diagram and explanation of the relationships are particularly clear and useful.

- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  - The UML diagram was very helpful when developing the code. It was easy to reference and really helps with staying on track.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  - The Evaluation section could use another run-through. It could be improved by being more specific, and adding more details and explanations.  

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  - I wanted to make sure that users on lower-end devices coudl still have a smooth experience, so I tried to be thoughtful about memory management and optimization by suggesting lazy loading, for example. I wanted user to have a safe and secure experiecnce by taking security measures like two-factor authorization. I wanted to make sure there was good cross-platform compatibility to give more players on different devices a smooth experience.

- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  - I tried to approach it systematically, making sure I had a good understanding of the high-level requirements, then focusing on the specific technical details. For future projects, I'd take what I learned from this experience and build on that. I would use UML diagrams and make sure they're complete and fully fleshed out. I would go over the design document in many iterations, making sure all of the information I need is there, and trying to improve each iteration until it's a complete document. I've learned that the more time that is spent on the planning phase, the easier the development phase will be.
